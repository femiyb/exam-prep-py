    "question": "Discuss the process of analyzing qualitative data in IT research. Describe the steps involved in thematic analysis.",
    "proposedAnswer": "Analyzing qualitative data in IT research involves identifying, analyzing, and reporting patterns (themes) within the data. Thematic analysis steps include familiarizing oneself with the data, generating initial codes, searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining and naming themes, and producing the report. This method enables in-depth insights into complex data sets."

    "question": "Explain the process and importance of hypothesis testing in quantitative IT research. Include a discussion on null and alternative hypotheses.",
    "proposedAnswer": "Hypothesis testing in quantitative IT research involves making an assumption (the hypothesis) about a population parameter and then using statistical tests to determine if the data supports this assumption. The null hypothesis posits no effect or relationship, while the alternative hypothesis suggests there is. The process is important for objectively determining if the observed data can statistically support the research hypothesis."
