      "question": "Explain the concept of a trust model in the context of PKI. Provide examples of different types of trust models.",
      "proposedAnswer": "A trust model defines how parties in a network trust each other's identities. In PKI, common trust models include the hierarchical trust model, where a central root authority issues certificates; the web of trust model, where users create their own certificates and trust is established through mutual verification; and the direct trust model, where trust is established through direct exchange and verification of certificates."

    {
      "id": 28,
      "question": "Describe the process and importance of certificate revocation in PKI.",
      "proposedAnswer": "Certificate revocation is the process of invalidating a digital certificate before its expiration date. This is important to ensure that compromised or no longer valid certificates cannot be used maliciously. Revocation is typically managed through Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP), which allow users and systems to verify the current status of a certificate."

      "question": "What are the primary threats to database security and how can they be mitigated?",
      "proposedAnswer": "Primary threats to database security include SQL injection attacks, unauthorized access, and data breaches. These can be mitigated through methods such as input validation and prepared statements to prevent SQL injection, robust access control mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access data, and encryption to protect data at rest and in transit."
    },
    {
      "id": 30,
      "question": "Explain the concepts of authentication and authorization and their significance in information security.",
      "proposedAnswer": "Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system, typically through credentials such as passwords, biometrics, or tokens. Authorization determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do, often managed through role-based or attribute-based access control. Both are critical for ensuring that only authorized users can access and perform actions on information systems."

    {
      "id": 31,
      "question": "How does the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) enhance security in PKI compared to traditional Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)?",
      "proposedAnswer": "OCSP enhances security by providing real-time verification of a certificate's revocation status, unlike CRLs, which are periodically updated lists. OCSP allows clients to query the status of a certificate directly from the issuing CA, ensuring that the most current information is used to determine a certificate's validity, thus improving the reliability of the revocation process."
    },
    {
      "id": 32,
      "question": "What are the key differences between a web of trust and a hierarchical trust model?",
      "proposedAnswer": "In a web of trust, individuals mutually verify each other's keys, creating a decentralized network of trust relationships. In contrast, a hierarchical trust model relies on a central root authority and intermediate authorities to issue and manage certificates, establishing a structured and centralized trust hierarchy. The web of trust is more flexible but less structured, while the hierarchical model provides a clear and organized trust framework."
