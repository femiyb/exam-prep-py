  {
    "id": 7,
    "question": "Describe the process and goals of requirements analysis and specification in software engineering.",
    "proposedAnswer": "The process involves gathering and analyzing user requirements to create a detailed software requirements specification (SRS) document. The goal is to provide a clear, comprehensive description of the functional and non-functional requirements of the software to be developed."
  },
  {
    "id": 8,
    "question": "How do functional requirements differ from nonfunctional requirements in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document?",
    "proposedAnswer": "Functional requirements describe the specific behavior or functions of the software, while nonfunctional requirements address the software's performance, usability, reliability, and other quality attributes."

    "id": 9,
    "question": "Discuss the significance of Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) in software design and their components.",
    "proposedAnswer": "DFDs are crucial in software design for visualizing the flow of data through the system, identifying the system's input and output, and facilitating the understanding of the system's functionality. The main components include processes, data flows, data stores, and external entities."

  {
    "id": 10,
    "question": "Explain the concept of modularization in software design and its benefits.",
    "proposedAnswer": "Modularization involves dividing a software system into smaller, manageable modules. Benefits include improved maintainability, reusability, and scalability, as well as facilitating parallel development."
  },
  {
    "id": 11,
    "question": "Define cohesion and coupling in the context of software design, and explain why they are important metrics.",
    "proposedAnswer": "Cohesion refers to the degree to which the elements within a module belong together, while coupling describes how closely connected different modules are. High cohesion and low coupling are desirable for modular, maintainable, and flexible software design."
  },
  {
    "id": 12,
    "question": "Describe the Object-Oriented Design process and its advantages over traditional structured design methods.",
    "proposedAnswer": "Object-Oriented Design (OOD) focuses on designing software systems using objects and classes. It offers advantages such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which facilitate more natural modeling of real-world problems and enhance code reusability and maintainability."

  {
    "id": 13,
    "question": "Explain the difference between top-down and bottom-up design approaches in software engineering.",
    "proposedAnswer": "The top-down approach starts with the most general system components and progressively refines them into more detailed components. In contrast, the bottom-up approach begins with detailed components, which are gradually combined into more general system components."
  },
  {
    "id": 14,
    "question": "Describe the purpose of a Data Dictionary in the context of software development and its components.",
    "proposedAnswer": "A Data Dictionary is a centralized repository of information about data, such as meaning, relationships to other data, origin, usage, and format. It ensures consistency and clarity in the use and interpretation of data elements."
  },
  {
    "id": 15,
    "question": "Explain the concept of a Decision Tree and its application in decision-making processes within software engineering.",
    "proposedAnswer": "A Decision Tree is a graphical representation that uses branching methods to illustrate every possible outcome of a decision. It is used in software engineering for planning and decision-making processes, especially in complex systems with multiple choices and outcomes."
